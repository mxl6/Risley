<p>In addition to offering a ton of programming, Risley also has large programming spaces that are useful for meetings, rehearsals, and other functions. Below you can find calendars with availability of spaces. To reserve a space, you will need to attend Risley&#39;s hall council (Kommittee) on Sundays at 9:00 PM in the Central Living Room to allocate for the space.</p>

<h2>What are the spaces?</h2>

<hr />
<p>Like many aspects of Risley, the spaces we use have fun names that can be confusing for newcomers. Here are the spaces we have available and a little about what they are used for.</p>

<p><strong>CENTRAL LIVING ROOM </strong>- As the name implies, this is the central space on the first floor and the first room you see as you enter Risley from the front door. It is marked by beautiful stained-glass windows that were made in Risley! This space has a large table for studying, four couches, a piano, and is the space used for weekly Kommittee meetings. The large space makes it popular for rehearsals for shows with Risley Theatre.</p>

<p><strong>COWCLIFFES LOUNGE </strong>- This is the programming space on the first floor to the left when you come in the front doors. This space has a large wooden table with chairs, and a few couches. Cowcliffes is usually used for our food-based programs like Eat This! (Wednesdays) and RisBrunch (Saturdays) because it has the programming kitchen attached.</p>

<p><strong>DANCE STUDIO </strong>- Also sometimes called the &quot;Music Room&quot; because of the large piano in the space and the popular use for musical rehearsals. The room has a wooden floor, a fully-mirrored wall, a piano, and a barre. Technically on the basement level, this space can be found just passed the laundry rooms on the east side of the building, or more easily from the back courtyard for direct access.</p>

<p><strong>GREAT HALL </strong>- Most commonly used as Risley Dining, the Great Hall is a very large space located to the right and down a small set of stairs as you enter the front doors that is very limited in availability. Some of the larger programs at Risley like Masquerave and The Rocky Horror Picture Show occur in this space, but it is primarily used by Dining for lunch and dinner service during the week. You can find out more about the dining options <a href="http://living.sas.cornell.edu/dine/wheretoeat/AYCTEdiningrooms/risley.cfm"><b>HERE. </b></a></p>

<p><strong>TAMMANY COFFEE HOUSE </strong>- Fridays and Saturdays are great times to be entertained and refreshed. This space hosts bands, comedy groups, improv troupes, movie nights, Life Drawing, and Faculty Fellow dinners throughout the year. The defining feature of this space is the bar where you can get espresso drinks, Italian sodas, milk shakes, and other treats during programs. This space is on the first floor and located just past Risley Dining.</p>

<p><strong>TV ROOM </strong>- This space is located to the right as you walk in the front door and holds the TV as well as the Wii for the community. There are couches in the space for recreational viewing but is also occasionally used for movies, karaoke, and game nights.</p>
