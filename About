<h3><strong><a id="History" name="History"></a>History</strong></h3>

<p>Since its inception in 1970, the college has resided in Risley Hall, a beautiful castle-like building built in 1913. Risley houses a popular 80-seat student-run theatre, a community coffeehouse, a stained-glass shop, two music practice rooms, a multimedia studio, a recording studio, a print shop, wood and metal shops, an art studio, a darkroom, a video-editing studio, a sewing shop, and a pottery studio. All of that, and one of the best-kept secrets on campus &ndash; <a href="http://living.sas.cornell.edu/living/dine/wheretoeat/AYCTEdiningrooms/risley.cfm" target="_blank">Risley Dining</a>, a dining&nbsp;room modeled after the Christ Church Refectory at Oxford University.</p>

<p>&#39;Risleyites&#39;&#39; are proud not only of its rich history, but also the traditions that make it such a unique and special place. Annual events such as the MasqueRave - Halloween-themed bash, or the traditional reading of Handel&#39;s Messiah are open to the entire Cornell community. There are also numerous house activities like coffeehouse drawing sessions, concerts, theatrical and dance productions, and the twice-annual showing of cult film classic The Rocky Horror Picture Show complete with a live performance.</p>
