<h1>Kommittee</h1>

<p>Kommittee is the Residence Hall Leadership Organization for Risley Residential College. Student leadership within Risley is acute and essential to the success of the community. Risley operates on the principle that students should have a voice within the community and are therefore strongly encouraged to become a part of the Kommittee structure. Generally speaking, Kommittee acts both as the brain of Risley, directing activities towards their goals, and as the mouth, articulating goals and program planning to Risley members, Residential &amp; New Student Programs, Cornell University, and beyond.&nbsp; Kommittee&rsquo;s responsibilities include assisting the RHD in managing Risley finances, space reservations, in-house staffing procedures, housing procedures, managing of Risley Theatre/Tammany Coffee House, Managing the Risley Shops, and ensuring the accomplishment of all traditional weekly and annual traditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Why did you want to be a RisLord?</em></p>

<p><em>&nbsp;</em>&quot;I wanted to be a RisLord because it brings me great joy to share my enthusiasm for Risley with the building&#39;s newest residents--especially since the first few days are integral to a new student&#39;s experience at Cornell!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
