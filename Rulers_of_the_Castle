<p>&quot;I am from Las Cruces, New Mexico and I am the seventh of eight kids in my family. I attended a performing arts high school where I studied traditional Flamenco dance. I am currently a Sophomore studying Hotel Administration in the hopes of opening an Inn on P.E.I, Canada.&nbsp; When I am not in my room studying or binging Netflix, you can find me at Statler or grabbing the greatest ice cream in America at the Dairy Bar. In addition to various hotel clubs, I am also a Community Group leader for Cru Student Ministries. I love plants, puppies, hiking, peanut butter, coffee, and the slap happy laughter of late nights. Most of all, I love the arts and whether a genuine thespian or a creativity novice, I look forward to the opportunity to grow with others in a community that values self-discovery and artistic expression.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hello! My name is Jacob Kuhn and I am a senior studying Landscape Architecture in CALS. When I&#39;m not crying over my desk at studio, I can be found reading books or binging Netflix in my room, working on a production in Risley Theater, and/or attempting to smash the patriarchy, heteronormativity, and social injustice. If you have a concern you&#39;d like to address, or you just want to hang out with little ol&#39; me, swing by my room (450) for some tea/coffee and conversation! Hope to see everyone soon and hear about all the fantastic things you&#39;re up to! Welcome to Risley!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My name is Matthew Lin, and people also call me Matt, Matthew, or MattLin. I am a junior in CALS, majoring in biology, concentrating in general biology, and minoring in music, and education. In my free time I enjoy running around the various trails of the area, and tutoring down at Ithaca High School. Last year as the Arts RA, I mainly worked with The Shops and led the Arts Subcommittee. I learned a lot during my first year, but there&#39;s still plenty more to do! I hope to make all building spaces the best they can be, host several educational programs, and implement a few sustainability ideas. I&#39;m usually in common spaces, the RA Office, or in my room with the door open.</p>

<p>I look forward to working with you all!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My name is Carolyn Todd,I am a junior human development major in the college of Human Ecology, and I am so excited for my first year as an RA in Risley. Some of my interests include sports(I am a die-hard Yankees and Steelers fan), spoken word poetry, and musical theatre. I am also an inspirational quote fiend, so whenever you need a pick-me-up quote feel free to come to me :). On campus, I am involved in Greek life, the club field hockey team, a pre-health club called PATCH, and a volunteer in a research lab. I absolutely love getting to know new people and look forward to making this year the best one yet!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
