<p>Welcome to the Castle! That&#39;s right, you have reached the organization page for Risley Residential College for the Creative and Performing Arts. &nbsp;Risley Hall is a truly unique community full of inspiring and talented individuals. &nbsp;Our community is built upon a basic love and respect of all forms of artistic expression, and to engage as a community of artists, thespians, and musicians. &nbsp;While all members of the Risley community have an appreciation for art, residents of Risley come from all walks of life, are enrolled in a wide variety of degree programs, and express their creativity in numerous different ways. &nbsp;Risley residents and community members often remain connected with Risley even after moving on from Cornell, as evidenced by our robust Risley Alumni population. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Just as Risley&#39;s community is unmatched, so are it&#39;s resources. &nbsp;Risley is home to an 81-seat black box theater, 12 fine arts work shops, a library, a performance space, a dance studio, lounges, and of course the famous Risley Dining Hall! &nbsp;Residents and out-of-house members of our community utilize these resources to host a bevvy of annual Risley events, such as Masquerave, A Night at Hogwarts, VD Ball, The Reading of Handel&#39;s Messiah, RisExpo, productions by our very own Risley Theatre,&nbsp;and many others. &nbsp;Risley community members also utilize these resources in order to satisfy whatever creative craving they may have. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Risley&#39;s unique features do not stop there. &nbsp;Our community is mostly student-run. &nbsp;Our governing body is affectionately known as &quot;Kommittee&quot;. &nbsp;Kommittee meets weekly to discuss events, troubleshoot community concerns, brainstorm ideas, and to decide how funds and space are best utilized for the community. &nbsp;Kommittee is often themed, allowing for a bit of humor amidst the necessary business of the meeting. &nbsp;Kommittee is open to any Risley community member to attend!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Living in Risley is truly a unique experience that would be hard to find just about anywhere else. &nbsp;We can&#39;t give away all of our secrets, but we invite you into The Castle to experience it for yourself!</p>
