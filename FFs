<h2><strong>Faculty Fellows</strong></h2>

<hr />
<p>North Campus Faculty Programs, a program of the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, oversees faculty involvement on North Campus and in the university owned residential communities in Collegetown, with a primary focus on the first-year experience.</p>

<p>Many Cornell faculty members are actively engaged in the residential communities around campus.&nbsp; They help to create a supportive environment that fosters academic and intellectual learning, personal development, well-being, and a sense of belonging. While faculty members are pivotal to each of these dimensions, they play a leadership role in the dimension of learning. Faculty in your community can help you explore intellectual topics, find research opportunities, navigate the first-year, experience other cultures, discover the Ithaca community, connect with faculty in other colleges, and much more.</p>

<p>Risley is grateful to have four&nbsp;faculty fellows this year.</p>
